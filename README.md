## Task 2A
### Approach
In this implementation, we use the Flush+Reload side-channel technique to communicate data covertly via the CPU cache. The sender influences the cache state, and the receiver measures memory access times to determine transmitted bits.

A shared file is mapped into memory using mmap(), allowing both sender and receiver to access the same memory region.

Synchronization by dividing into INTERVALS and only starting at the top of intervals.(Take larger to be accurate).

NUM_RELIABLE times bits are sent to ensure Accuracy

### Results
- **Accuracy:** Most of the time 100% some times 70% too
- **Bandwidth:** 2000bits/sec

You can also mention accuracy vs bandwidths that you observed while tuning.

## Task 2B
### Approach
[Describe your approach for Task 2B. Mention any techniques, or optimizations used.]

### Results
- **Accuracy:** [Report the accuracy obtained]
- **Bandwidth:** [Report the bandwidth obtained]

You can also mention accuracy vs bandwidths that you observed while tuning.


## Task 3
### Approach
[Describe your approach for Task 3. Mention any modifications or improvements from Task 2A/2B.]

### Changes from Previous Tasks
[Explain any changes made in this task compared to Task 2A/2B.]

### Results
#### Image Transmission
- **Sent Image:** *(Provide the image file name or attach the image)*
- **Received Image:** *(Provide the image file name or attach the image)*
- **Time taken:** How long did it take for the transmission.


#### Audio Transmission
- **Sent Audio:** *(Provide the audio file name or attach the audio)*
- **Received Audio:** *(Provide the audio file name or attach the audio)*
- **Time taken:** How long did it take for the transmission.


## Plagiarism Checklist
Your answers should be written in a new line below each bullet.

1. Have you strictly adhered to the submission guidelines?

2. Have you received or provided any assistance for this assignment beyond public discussions with peers/TAs?

3. If you answered "yes" to the previous question, please specify what part of code you've taken and from whom you've taken it.


## Directory Structure
Folders - `task2a`, `task2b`, `task3a` and optionally `task3b`. Each of these directories should contain:

1. `sender.c`
2. `receiver.c`
3. `utils.c`
4. `utils.h`
5. `MakeFile`
6. Additional relevant files

If the implementation for `task3a` and `task3b` is the same, put the code in the folder `task3a`. Apart from the above folders, there should be a completely filled README file.


Your submission should be `zip` file with \<roll-number\>.zip. Only one team member should submit, else there will be penalties.
